	<h1> Did you perhaps… Come here… Intending to ‘Pursue’ me? I see… So you are pursuing me… I understand. So then, the lid of this jar, have you tried opening it? What I’m saying is… Simply looking at that jar from the outside, you wouldn’t know for certain that what’s inside it is a ‘Fruit’, no…? Isn’t that right? Though it certainly seems to be fragments of ‘Something’… But looking from the outside, those may be potato fragments… or perhaps onion fragments… it may not look like an onion… but that definitely looks like it could be a large mushroom! How can you be so definitive in saying that what’s inside that jar is a ‘Fruit’? I’m explaining the fact that you ‘Opened’ the jar. Because you received that package, you opened the lid with your hands, you ‘Smelled’ it. And it’s because it gave off the sweet and sour scent of a ‘Fruit’… that you came into this room thinking it was a ‘Fruit’. You got all excited thinking ‘I’ve got an exclusive scoop here’, didn’t you? And then… you perhaps got some fruit juice from the lid stuck to your finger. Just a little of it. Or perhaps you were careless and licked that finger. If fate were particularly unlucky, there’s a rather good chance that when you were putting the lid back on, some fruit juice seeped into a small cut on your skin or your fingernail. <h1/>
  <h1>  Meu nome é Yoshikage Kira. Tenho 33 anos. Minha casa fica na parte nordeste de Morioh, onde todas as moradias são, e eu não sou casado. Eu trabalho como funcionário das lojas de departamento Kame Yu, e chego em casa todos os dias às oito da noite, no máximo. Eu não fumo, mas ocasionalmente bebo. Estou na cama às 23h e me certifico de ter oito horas de sono, não importa o que aconteça. Depois de tomar um copo de leite morno e fazer cerca de vinte minutos de alongamentos antes de ir para a cama, geralmente não tenho problemas para dormir até de manhã. Assim como um bebê, eu acordo sem qualquer fadiga ou estresse pela manhã. Foi-me dito que não houve problemas no meu último check-up. Estou tentando explicar que sou uma pessoa que deseja viver uma vida muito tranquila. Eu cuido para não me incomodar com quaisquer inimigos, como ganhar e perder, que me faria perder o sono à noite. É assim que eu lido com a sociedade e sei que é isso que me traz felicidade. Embora, se eu fosse lutar, não perderia para ninguém. </h1>
  <h1> Suppose that you were sitting down at this table. The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your ‘left’? Or the one on your ‘right’? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is ‘correct’ too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute ‘society’ with the ‘Universe’. The correct answer is that ‘It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.’ …Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there’s no choice but for others to also take the ‘right’ napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is ‘society’… Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of ‘right or left?’! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who ‘takes the napkin first’ must be someone who is respected by all. It’s not that anyone can fulfill this role… Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the ‘losers’. In the case of this table, the ‘eldest’ or the ‘Master of the party’ will take the napkin first… Because everyone ‘respects’ those individuals. </h1>
